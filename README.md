# GoLeetCode – A Responsible Approach to LeetCode Practice

## 🚀 Overview

**GoLeetCode** is a browser extension designed to promote ethical, meaningful, and skill-building LeetCode practice. Unlike tools that offer instant answers, GoLeetCode emphasizes **learning through problem-solving**, helping users develop strong coding and algorithmic thinking.

## 🎯 Why GoLeetCode?

Most tools like *FLeetCode* prioritize quick solutions, often at the cost of genuine understanding. **GoLeetCode** takes a fundamentally different approach:

- ✅ **Learning First**: Instead of handing out code, GoLeetCode offers structured hints and problem-solving strategies.
- ✅ **Ethical Assistance**: The AI never reveals full solutions or code—preserving the integrity of your learning process.
- ✅ **Critical Thinking Focus**: Encourages deep engagement with problems, not shortcuts.
- ✅ **Responsible Practice**: Guides users to LeetCode’s official solution tab if they wish to view full answers after trying.
